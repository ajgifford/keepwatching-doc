# Shows
When navigating to the Shows page, a default filter of 'Not Watched, Watching' is applied to the profile's list of shows that they have favorited.

The list of shows can further be filtered by Genre, Streaming Service and Watch Status.

Users can mark a show as watched (if current status is not watched or watching) or not watched (if current status is watched). Marking a show as watched will also mark all seasons and episodes for that show as watched and vice versa for not watched.

Selecting a show will take the user into the details for that show. This view will show a list of the shows seasons and each season can be expanded to display the episodes for the season. Like shows, the watch status of a season or episode can be set.
