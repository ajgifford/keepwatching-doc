# Shows

## Shows List
The shows page displays all of the shows that have been favorited for a profile. When navigating to the page, a default filter of 'Not Watched, Watching' is applied to the list. Shows are sorted first by their watch status and then alphabetically.

The list of shows can further be filtered by Genre, Streaming Service and Watch Status.

### Watch Status
Users can mark a show as Watched (if current status is not watched or watching and there are no future season or episodes), Up To Date (if current status is not watched or watching and there are future season or episodes) or Not Watched (if current status is Watched or Up To Date). Changing the status of show will also change the status of all seasons and episodes for that show.
