## Advanced Filtering Options

### Year Filtering

Narrow down your search by premiere year:

1. **Select Premier Year**
   - Use the "Premier Year" dropdown to choose a specific year
   - Options range from the current year back to 1978
   - Select "Any Year" to search across all time periods

*[Screenshot: Year dropdown menu showing available options]*

2. **Combine with Search Terms**
   - Year filtering works alongside your text search
   - For example: Search "Star" + Year "1977" to find "Star Wars"
   - This helps when multiple shows/movies have similar names

## Advanced Search Strategies

### Finding Specific Content

1. **Use Partial Titles**
   - Don't worry about exact spelling or complete titles
   - Search "Breaking" to find "Breaking Bad"
   - The system finds close matches automatically

2. **Combine Filters Effectively**
   - Use year + partial title for shows with common names
   - Example: "The Office" + "2005" for the US version vs "2001" for UK version

3. **Try Different Sort Orders**
   - Sort by rating to find the highest-quality content
   - Sort by premiere date to see chronological releases
   - Sort by popularity to find trending content

*[Screenshot: Example of effective filter combination]*

### Content Type Optimization

1. **TV Show Searches**
   - Remember that TV shows may have multiple seasons
   - The search shows the original premiere date, not individual season dates

2. **Movie Searches**
   - Movies show their theatrical release date
   - Some content may be available on streaming before or after theatrical release

## Clearing and Refining Searches

### Starting Fresh

1. **Clear Search Terms**
   - Click the "X" button in the search box to clear your text
   - This removes your search term but keeps other filter settings

*[Screenshot: Clear search button (X) in search box]*

2. **Reset All Filters**
   - Change content type, year, or sorting to modify your search
   - Each change requires clicking "Search" again to apply

### Refining Results

1. **Too Many Results?**
   - Add year filtering to narrow down options
   - Use more specific search terms
   - Apply sorting to prioritize by rating or popularity

2. **Too Few Results?**
   - Remove year filtering to search all time periods
   - Try shorter or more general search terms
   - Check spelling of search terms

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Results Found

If your search returns no results:
- **Check spelling** of your search terms
- **Try shorter keywords** instead of full titles
- **Remove year filtering** to search all time periods
- **Switch content types** (TV Shows vs Movies)

### Search Not Working

If the search button doesn't respond:
- **Verify you've entered a search term** in the text box
- **Check your internet connection**
- **Try refreshing the page** and searching again

## Tips for Effective Searching

### Search Term Strategies

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**
   - Begin with general terms, then add filters
   - Example: "Marvel" → filter by movies → sort by rating

2. **Use Alternative Titles**
   - Try both formal and common names
   - Search "Game of Thrones" and "GOT"

3. **Search by Actor or Creator**
   - While not always supported, try searching creator names
   - Some results may include content associated with specific people

### Making the Most of Results

1. **Preview Before Adding a Favorite**
   - Read descriptions carefully to ensure content matches your interests
   - Check ratings and genres to gauge content quality and type

2. **Batch Add Favorite**
   - Add multiple interesting items to your collection in one search session
   - You can organize and prioritize them later in your Shows/Movies pages

3. **Explore Similar Content**
   - When you find something you like, note the genres and year
   - Search for similar combinations to find related content

1. **Visit Your Collections**
   - Go to the Shows or Movies pages to see your favorited content
   - Set watch status and begin tracking your viewing progress
