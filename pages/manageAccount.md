## Profile Switching Workflow

### Understanding Active vs Default Profiles
- **Active Profile**: The profile currently being used for viewing and tracking
- **Default Profile**: The profile automatically selected when you log in

### Best Practices for Multiple Profiles
1. **Family Setup**: Create separate profiles for each family member
2. **Content Separation**: Use different profiles for different types of content (e.g., "Kids Shows", "Adult Content")
3. **Progress Tracking**: Each profile maintains independent watch history and progress

### Switching Profiles
When you set a new active profile:
1. All content lists (shows, movies) update to reflect that profile's data
2. Statistics and progress tracking switch to the new profile
3. Recommendations become personalized to that profile's viewing history
4. The navigation and home page update to show the active profile's information

## Tips and Best Practices

### Profile Organization
- Use descriptive names for profiles (e.g., "Mom", "Kids", "Family Movies")
- Upload profile pictures to make profiles easily identifiable
- Set appropriate default profiles for your primary viewing

### Account Management
- Review account statistics periodically to understand viewing patterns

### Data Management
- Be cautious when deleting profiles as this removes all watch history
- Use the "Set Active" feature to quickly switch between family members
- Consider creating separate profiles for different viewing contexts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Profile not updating after switching:**
- Refresh the page after switching active profiles
- Check that the profile change was successful by verifying the "Active Profile" field

**Upload issues with profile pictures:**
- Ensure image files are in supported formats (JPG, PNG, GIF)
- Check that image file size is reasonable (under 2MB)
- Try refreshing the page if uploads seem stuck

**Email verification not working:**
- Check your spam/junk folder for verification emails
- Ensure your email address is correct in your account settings
- Try requesting verification again if the first email doesn't arrive

**Profile deletion restrictions:**
- You cannot delete your default profile - set a different default first
- Ensure you really want to delete the profile as this action is permanent
