The Movies feature in KeepWatching allows you to manage your favorite movies, track what you've watched, and discover new films. This guide covers how to use the Movies page and Movie Details page to build and manage your personal movie collection.

## Movies Page Overview

The Movies page serves as your personal movie library, displaying all the films you've added to your watchlist. Unlike TV shows, movies have a simpler tracking system focused on whether you've watched them or plan to watch them.
